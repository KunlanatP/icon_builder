/// Use with the [Icon] class to show specific icons.
///
/// Icons are identified by their name as listed below.
///
/// To use this class, make sure you declare the font in your
/// project's `pubspec.yaml` file in the `fonts` section. This ensures that
/// the "UiIcons" font is included in your application. This font is used to
/// display the icons. For example:
/// 
/// ```yaml
/// flutter:
///   fonts:
///     - family: UiIcons
///       fonts:
///         - asset: fonts/ui_icons.ttf
/// ```
